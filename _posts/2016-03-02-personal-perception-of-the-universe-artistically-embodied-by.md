## Art is a tender song, immortal, undefeatable, inherent to life

> As of my art, its source, the driving force that makes me go on working, that gives me no rest, I must confess I cannot explain

> Real painting, as one person aptly said, resembles precious stones crushed against canvases; precise definition, precious stones crushed against flat surface. In painting every dab of color must be colorful and unique and at the same time attuned to the harmonious whole of the picture. A very difficult task indeed.

> The art of painting is thinking in paints; it is a wish, a daring dream, to challenge transience, death, disappearance. And I am one simple man whose, only purpose is painting, and neither have I ever failed it nor has it ever failed me.
