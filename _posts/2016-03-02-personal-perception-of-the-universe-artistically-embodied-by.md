## Art is a tender song, immortal, undefeatable, inherent to life

> As of my art, its source, the driving force that makes me go on working, that gives me no rest, I must confess I cannot explain

> Real painting, as one person aptly said, resembles precious stones crushed against canvases; precise definition, precious stones crushed against flat surface.

> The art of painting is thinking in paints; it is a wish, a daring dream, to challenge transience, death, disappearance. And I am one simple man whose, only purpose is painting, and neither have I ever failed it nor has it ever failed me.
